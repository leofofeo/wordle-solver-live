# Wordle

If you use the process of elimination and the right starting words, it's 
almost impossible to lose at Wordle. At one point it became more fun to write a program
to do it or help me when I was feeling lazy. I originally implemented it the solver
as a CLI (now [ported over to Clojure](https://github.com/leofofeo/wordle-solver)) and decided to
clean up the logic and extend it using LiveView for interactivity and greater usability. 
Eventually I'll extend it to allow for words greater than 5 characters in length.
